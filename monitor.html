        <h1>What Is Monitor?</h1>
     <p><strong>A computer monitor is an electronic device that shows pictures for computers. Monitors often look like smaller televisions. The main difference between a monitor and a television is that a monitor does not have a television tuner to change channels. Monitors often have higher display resolution than televisions. A high display resolution makes it easier to see smaller letters and fine graphics.</strong>
