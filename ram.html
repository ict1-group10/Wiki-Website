        <h1>What Is Ram?</h1>
     <p><strong>RAM stands for <u>random-access memory</u>, but what does that mean? Your computer RAM is essentially short term memory where data is stored as the processor needs it. This isn't to be confused with long-term data that's stored on your hard drive, which stays there even when your computer is turned off.</strong>
