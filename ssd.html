        <h1>What Is SSD?</h1>
     <p><strong>A <u>solid-state drive</u>(SSD) is a new generation of storage device used in computers. SSDs store data using flash-based memory, which is much faster than the traditional hard disks they've come to replace. SSDs also have no moving parts, and upgrading to one is a great way to speed up your computer and make it more resilient. Learn how SSDs work and how to keep them optimized with performance-boosting software.</strong></p>
